# EXPLANATORY-BANK-DATA-ANALYSIS-WITH-PYTHON
PROJECTS
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on bank customer data, aiming to uncover the significance of relationships between important variables in the dataset.
Dataset
The dataset consists of bank customer data, including:
- Demographic information (age, gender)
- Financial data (balance, deposit, loan status)
- Other relevant variables (credit score, employment status)
Objectives
The objectives of this EDA are to:
- Understand the distribution and summary statistics of each variable
- Identify correlations and relationships between variables
- Visualize key findings using plots and charts
- Inform future modeling and machine learning efforts
Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics and data visualization
- Correlation analysis and heatmap visualization
- Pairplot analysis for multivariate relationships
Key Findings
- Significant correlations between balance, deposit, and loan status
- Age and credit score have a positive correlation
- Employment status affects loan approval
